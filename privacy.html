                If you are located outside the United States and choose to use the App, please note that we transfer your information to the United States and process it there.

            <h2>9. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>

            <p>
                The App may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Steer Corp. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties.

            </p>

            <h2>10. Astrology Services Disclaimer</h2>

            <p>
                Steer provides Vedic astrology insights for <strong>entertainment, self-reflection, and personal development purposes only</strong>. Astrological interpretations are based on traditional Vedic principles combined with AI analysis and may vary from other sources or interpretations.
            </p>

            <h3>10.1 Nature of Astrological Insights</h3>
            <p>By using the App, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not claim to predict the future or guarantee any outcomes</li>
                <li>Astrological insights are subjective interpretations based on traditional Vedic principles</li>
                <li>Results may differ from those provided by other astrologers or astrological services</li>
                <li>Astrology is not scientifically validated and should be treated as a tool for reflection, not fact</li>
                <li>You assume full responsibility for how you interpret and apply astrological information in your life</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>10.2 AI Accuracy and Limitations</h3>
            <p>
                The App uses artificial intelligence to generate personalized insights based on your Vedic birth chart. While our AI provides suggestions and perspectives, it does not make automated decisions that have legal or similarly significant effects on you. You maintain full control over your decisions and actions.
            </p>
            <p>Our AI-powered features may occasionally:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generate inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent information</li>
                <li>Misinterpret user questions or context</li>
                <li>Provide responses that conflict with traditional astrological texts or other sources</li>
                <li>Experience temporary service disruptions or errors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We continuously work to improve accuracy but cannot guarantee error-free performance. AI-generated content should be considered one perspective among many, not definitive guidance.
            </p>

            <h3>10.3 Professional Advice Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Important:</strong> The insights provided by the App are for informational and guidance purposes only and should <strong>not</strong> be considered as professional medical, legal, financial, or psychological advice. You should:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Not make important life decisions solely based on astrological insights</li>
                <li>Always consult qualified professionals (doctors, lawyers, financial advisors, therapists) for matters requiring professional expertise</li>
                <li>Seek immediate professional help for any medical, mental health, or safety concerns</li>
                <li>Use astrological insights as one of many inputs in your decision-making process, not as the sole determining factor</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>11. California Privacy Rights</h2>

            <p>If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):</p>

            <h2>14. Do Not Track Signals</h2>

            <p>
                Some web browsers and mobile devices have a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals to websites and apps that you do not want to be tracked. Currently, there is no uniform standard for recognizing DNT signals. As such, the App does not respond to DNT browser signals at this time.
            </p>

            <h2>15. Your Consent</h2>

                By using the App, you consent to this Privacy Policy and agree to its terms. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App.
            </p>

            <h2>16. Limitation of Liability</h2>

            <p>
                We recognize that birth information (date, time, and location of birth) constitutes sensitive personal data because it:

            <ul>

                <li>Holds cultural and spiritual significance in many traditions</li>
                <li>May be used in identity verification by some institutions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>17.2 Your Explicit Consent</h3>
            <p>
                By providing your birth details (date, time, and place of birth) to the App, you explicitly consent to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Secure storage of this data on our servers and cloud infrastructure</li>
                <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Processing by our systems and third-party AI services solely for the purpose of generating astrological calculations and personalized insights</li>
                <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Retention of this data until you delete your profile or account</li>
                <li><strong>Use:</strong> Use of this data exclusively for providing astrological services and improving the accuracy of our calculations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>17.3 Your Control Over Birth Data</h3>

                You maintain control over your sensitive birth information at all times:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can view your stored birth details in your profile settings</li>
                <li>You can update or correct your birth information at any time</li>
                <li>You can delete your profile, which will remove all associated birth data</li>
                <li>You can request complete account deletion, which will permanently remove all your data within 30 days</li>
                <li>You can withdraw your consent at any time by deleting your profile or contacting us</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                We will never share your exact birth details in publicly shared content or use them for purposes other than providing astrological services.
