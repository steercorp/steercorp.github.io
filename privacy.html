            </p>

            <p>
                The App is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of consent in your jurisdiction).

            </p>

            <p>
                We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for international transfers, including using standard contractual clauses approved by relevant authorities.

            </p>

            <h2>10. AI and Automated Decision-Making</h2>

            <p>
                The App uses artificial intelligence to generate personalized insights and life guidance based on your Vedic birth chart.

You maintain full control over your decisions and actions.
            </p>

            <p>
                The insights provided by the App are for informational and guidance purposes only and should not be considered as professional medical, legal, financial, or psychological advice. Always consult with qualified professionals for important life decisions.
            </p>

            <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

            <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, legal requirements, or other factors. We will notify you of any material changes by:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Posting the updated Privacy Policy in the App with a new "Last Updated" date</li>

                Your continued use of the App after any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
            </p>

            <h2>14. Do Not Track Signals</h2>

            <p>
                Some web browsers and mobile devices have a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals to websites and apps that you do not want to be tracked. Currently, there is no uniform standard for recognizing DNT signals. As such, the App does not respond to DNT browser signals at this time.
            </p>

            <h2>15. Your Consent</h2>

            <p>
